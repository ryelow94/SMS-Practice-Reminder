        This app is intended to help you complete your practice goals for
        learning an instrument, but can really be used for a multitude of
        purposes such as learning a language or practicing your coding skills. By entering your phone number, you will receive a text message
        asking if you have completed your practice goals for the day. You can
        reply STOP to stop recieving reminders and START to start them again. If
        you respond 'No' to a practice reminder, the app will remind you 2
        minutes from your response. If you respond 'yes' to a reminder, the app
        will not send you any more notifications until you re-enter your phone
        number on the webpage.
